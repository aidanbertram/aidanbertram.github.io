        <h2>Vivaldi's The Four Seasons</h2>
        <p>OCT14-16 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00<br><br>
            Symphonic bliss awaits you as your Colorado Symphony and guest conductor Aram Demirjian present a<br>
            powerhouse program highlighted by Vivaldi’s programmatic masterpiece, The Four Seasons. As striking<br>
            and admired as ever, this work conjures imagery that deftly captures the essence of spring, summer,<br>
            autumn, and winter through music that manages to remain strikingly modern three centuries after its<br>
            debut. Paul Huang is just the virtuoso to embrace this beloved concerto in its return to Boettcher Concert<br>
            Hall.<br>
            The grand finale — Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony — is a meticulously structured meditation on fate<br>
            that endures as one of his most popular and identifiable compositions. Over four movements,<br>
            Tchaikovsky transforms his personal battle with fate into one of humanity’s most powerful works of art.<br>
            Among today’s best and brightest composers, Jessie Montgomery’s Strum draws on the spirit of dance,<br>
            movement, and American folk expressions in an ecstatic celebration that will have you on the edge of<br>
            your seat.<br><br>

        <h2>Beethoven Symphony No. 3 with Peter Oundjian</h2>
        <p>
            NOV 4-6 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00<br><br>
            History is replete with turning points and with the completion of his revolutionary Third Symphony,<br>
            Beethoven forever changed the idea of what a symphony could be. A clear bridging of the Classical and<br>
            Romantic eras, the Eroica (“Heroic”) Symphony explores what it means to be human in a work that is<br>
            larger and more emotional than a symphony had ever been before. In it, Beethoven’s passion rises to the<br>
            forefront, using broad strokes of sound to convey the very nature of humanity, while reimagining a future<br>
            for music filled with endless possibility. Cellist Sterling Elliott — a 2021 Avery Fisher Career Grant<br>
            recipient — brings youthful energy to Elgar’s Cello Concerto, a deeply emotional work filled with soaring<br>
            themes and quiet anguish that will leave audiences entranced. The Colorado Symphony Chorus takes<br>
            center stage on Vaughan Williams ’Walt Whitman-inspired Toward the Unknown Region, a remarkable<br>
            marriage of music and text, with Williams ’inspired music perfectly encapsulating Whitman’s noble,<br>
            humanistic aspirations. These works will spring to life in the hands of Maestro Peter Oundjian and your<br>
            Colorado Symphony.<br><br>

        <h2>Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 with Olga Kern</h2>
        <p>
            DEC 2-4 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00<br><br>
            Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky — so highly regarded for his symphonic compositions — placed himself among<br>
            the greats of the keyboard with the completion of his First Piano Concerto. The work is filled with<br>
            towering grandeur, gorgeously lyrical melodies, and unmistakable Romantic spirit. For pianists what<br>
            Everest is to climbers, the Concerto in B-flat has become the standard against which all virtuosos must<br>
            measure themselves, featuring iconic opening flourishes and a pyrotechnics-filled finale. Denver favorite<br>
            Olga Kern lends her dazzling technique and innate musicality to this cornerstone of the Classical Canon.<br>
            Your Colorado Symphony and Conductor Christian Reif — dubbed a “remarkable talent” by the San<br>
            Francisco Chronicle — conclude the program with Shostakovich’s stormy and brooding Tenth<br>
            Symphony. Written to symbolize the power of the people, Shostakovich employs memorable themes and<br>
            complex orchestrations that mirror his own battles against Soviet oppression. Ending on a triumphant<br>
            note, this is a finale that will leave you breathless.<br><br>

        <h2>Ravel’s Daphnis et Chloé</h2>
        <p>
            JAN13-15 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00<br><br>
            Be still my heart! A whirling celebration of pagan love awaits listeners with Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé,<br>
            which he called a “symphonie chorégraphique” rather than a ballet, reflecting a sense of powerful,<br>
            dramatic music which defies category and springs to life on terms all its own. Ravel’s exceptional score<br>
            creates a sensuous atmosphere with a lingering explosiveness residing just underneath the surface. Scored<br>
            for a massive orchestra and utilizing the ethereal, intangible tones of a wordless chorus, Ravel often<br>
            spotlights solo players in a way that recalls chamber music rather than merely using it as a show of force,<br>
            pulling listeners into a vast, visceral dreamscape of shimmering colors and hypnotic motion.<br>
            Szymanowski’s First Violin Concerto will shine in the hands of Concertmaster Yumi Hwang-Williams,<br>
            who brings expressive virtuosity to one of the first violin concertos of the modern era. The program opens<br>
            with Lili Boulanger’s D<br>
            ’un matin de printemps, meaning ‘On a spring morning, ’capturing the genius of<br>
            this prodigious composer who wrote over 50 compositions before tragically passing at the age of just 24.<br>
            This sweet and playful ode to spring is just the transportive overture to carry away your winter doldrums.<br><br>

        <h2>Beethoven Symphony No. 8</h2>
        <p>
            FEB 10-12 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00<br><br>
            Beethoven’s Eighth — which he referred to as “my little Symphony in F,”— is the most cheery, joyful,<br>
            and experimental of his symphonies. Its relatively compact scale allowed Beethoven to be more<br>
            imaginative and structurally radical than he could dare to be on the larger canvases of his other<br>
            symphonies. Light-hearted and full of charm, the Eighth is an often-overlooked gem that will shine under<br>
            the baton of Resident Conductor Christopher Dragon. Celebrate the Colorado Symphony Horns as they<br>
            take center stage on Schumann’s Konzertstück for 4 Horns and Orchestra, incorporating the warmth,<br>
            nobility, and hunting-horn origins of German Romantic-era music while conjuring images of the<br>
            unspoiled forests of the German landscape. In an ironic twist, the performance begins with a “Farewell”,<br>
            harkening back to the piece’s debut when Haydn instructed his musicians to stop playing one by one<br>
            during the final movement, snuff out the candle on their music stand, and walk off the stage in turn,<br>
            leaving just two violins to convey the final notes. In this uniquely imaginative performance, seeing<br>
            is believing.<br><br>

        <p>
            February 24-26 FRI-SAT 730 SUN 1<br><br>
            One of the most accomplished of all piano works, Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto features a striking<br>
            opening movement and a glorious finale, with beauty and virtuosic style throughout that makes it one of<br>
            the composer’s best. Your Colorado Symphony welcomes electrifying pianist Stewart Goodyear who is<br>
            just the firebrand to live up to the wiles of this majestic and vigorously demanding concerto.<br>
            Teddy Abrams — Musical America<br>

            energetic Worship Overture. Prokofiev’s Fifth Symphony was so well received that within months of its<br>
            American premiere, a portrait of the composer was featured on the cover of Time magazine. Prokofiev<br>
            wrote that he “conceived of it as glorifying the grandeur of the human spirit, praising the free and happy<br>
            man— his strength, his generosity, and the purity of his soul." This heroic and joyous work offers a<br>

        <p>
            March 10th-12th FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00<br><br>
            One of the foremost conductors of his generation, Alexander Shelley joins your Colorado Symphony for a<br>
            program that will leave you simply spellbound. Spanish composer Joaquín Rodrigo’s classical guitar<br>
            concerto Concierto de Aranjuez fills the concert hall with the immortal sounds and traditions of Spanish<br>
            romanticism in a must-hear interpretation from guitar virtuoso Pablo Sainz Villegas who was hailed as<br>
            “The global ambassador of Spanish guitar” by Billboard Magazine. Anna Clyne’s This Midnight Hour is<br>
            mysterious and foreboding, with musical twists and turns that show why she is considered one of the<br>
            preeminent composers of our time. Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra was called a concerto rather than a<br>
            symphony as each section of instruments is treated in a soloistic and virtuosic way, combining elements<br>
            of Western art music and Hungarian folk songs in a stirring finale to an evening of symphonic sublimity.<br><br>

        <h2>Brahms Requiem with Peter Oundjian</h2>
        <p>
            Mar 24–26 FRI–SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00<br><br>
            Unlike other Requiem Masses, Brahms ’A German Requiem is not primarily a Mass for the dead. Instead,<br>
            it is intended as comfort and solace for those left behind as they mourn the death of others. Confronting<br>
            life as much as it does death, Brahms further differentiates his Requiem by setting excerpts from the<br>
            Lutheran Bible and apocrypha in German instead of the Catholic, Latin text used in the Requiem Masses<br>
            by Mozart, Verdi, and Berlioz. The Colorado Symphony Chorus and two vocal soloists lend distinction to<br>
            this stunning masterpiece, which remains one of the most revered choral works ever composed. A taste<br>
            for the exotic surfaces often in the catalogue of Maurice Ravel and his orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade<br>
            is no exception. Named for the protagonist of One Thousand and One Nights, Shéhérazade is a woman<br>
            who employs her imagination as a means of escape. "Je voudrais voir...", she repeats, meaning "I would<br>
            like to see...", this refrain sets the tone for Ravel’s song cycle which drips with color evoking images of<br>
            the far east. Drawing on music from the opera, Weber’s Overture to Oberon is a celebration of the<br>
            supernatural realm. Like in Mozart's The Magic Flute, Weber establishes Oberon's horn as a mystical<br>
            instrument and its call as a leitmotif throughout the overture, unleashing an exuberant conversation<br>
            between instrumental voices and concluding with a virtuosic flourish conducted by Maestro<br>
            Peter Oundjian.<br><br>

            and 2021 Gramophone Artist of the Year, James Ehnes, to Boettcher Concert Hall for a reinvigoration of<br>

            masterpiece remain one of the most surprising and audacious ideas that the composer ever committed to<br>
            paper, setting the stage for a transcendent work that stands among the greats of the repertoire. Bruckner’s<br>
            Seventh Symphony emphatically elevated him into the ranks of legendary 19th century composers in a<br>
            work that is epic in scope and scale, with knowing nods to Beethoven’s Third Symphony and Wagner’s<br>
            Ring Cycle, including his use of the famous Wagner tubas. This revered work caps an awe-inspiring<br>
            program of inspiring masterworks led by Maestro Oundjian.<br><br>
